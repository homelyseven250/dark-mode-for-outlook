A chrome extension that applies a better dark mode to Outlook and removes the ad sidebar. Not affiliated with Microsoft.


## Installation
Hopefully I will add this to the Chrome Store in the future. Until then, `build.sh` is used to copy all files to build/, compile css, and zip the extension. You can do this any other way you wish. SASS is used for css compilation. After running `build.sh`, the build directory can be loaded into Chrome as an unpacked extension.
