A Chrome extension/Firefox add-on that applies a better (unofficial) dark mode to Microsoft Outlook and removes the ad sidebar. Compatible with Firefox mobile!


## Installation
The extension can be installed from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-mode-for-outlook/kjfbefcenipnnpbcbbklcidpjiamlcpl) or from the Firefox Add-on page [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-mode-for-outlook/).

If you wish to build yourself, `build.sh` is used to copy all files to the `build/` directory, compile css, and zip the extension. You can do this any other way you wish. [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) is used for CSS compilation. After running `build.sh`, the build directory can be loaded into Chrome. The `.zip` file can also be loaded into Firefox after renaming the file extension to `.xpi`.


## Usage
Just install the extension and go. Please **switch to Outlook Beta** on both desktop and mobile sites because I have not made a theme for classic Outlook yet. The extension does not have any other settings at the moment.
